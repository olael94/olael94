# Oliver Rivera
I’m a Software Engineering student with a background in Mechatronics Engineering and Design, passionate about developing innovative, user-centered software that bridges design and engineering. I enjoy tackling challenges that help me expand my skills and explore new technologies.

My focus is on full-stack development using Java, Spring Boot, React, MySQL, and AWS. I have hands-on experience creating RESTful APIs, deploying cloud-based applications, and integrating IoT systems such as the Raspberry Pi. I’m also skilled in software design patterns, test-driven development, and agile methodologies, which help deliver scalable and maintainable solutions.

I’m excited to collaborate with the tech community, contribute to innovative projects, and continue developing as a versatile software engineer who combines design thinking with engineering problem-solving.
